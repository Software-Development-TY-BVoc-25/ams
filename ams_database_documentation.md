# Attendance Management System (AMS) ‚Äì Database Documentation

This document serves as a complete guide to the **Attendance Management System (AMS)** database. It outlines the schema, design reasoning, relational flows, and constraints to make the system easy to understand and extend. Whether you're a new developer or an AI tool trying to work with the system, this will give you a full picture of how the database is structured and why.

---

## üéØ Purpose of the System

The AMS is built to:

-   Track student attendance on a subject-wise, day-wise basis
-   Handle CSV imports from the admin at the start of each semester
-   Allow teachers to mark attendance per subject, per month
-   Maintain historical data semester-wise without overwriting old records
-   Accommodate real-world needs like shared teachers across departments, non-teaching roles, and students changing enrollment over time

---

## üîÅ Key System Assumptions

-   Admin uploads student data every semester, which includes semester number and academic year
-   Teachers belong to one or more departments and teach one or more subjects
-   A subject can exist across semesters and departments
-   Students may have duplicate names but are uniquely identified by a system-assigned ID
-   Attendance is marked monthly in an Excel-like format
-   All past attendance records must be retained

---

## üìê Schema Overview and Design Decisions

Each table below explains _why_ it exists and _how_ it connects to others.

### 1. **academic_year** ‚Äì _Tracks sessional years like '2024‚Äì25'_

```sql
CREATE TABLE academic_year (
    Year_Label VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY
);
```

-   No auto ID ‚Äì the label itself (e.g., `'2025-26'`) is more human-readable and query-friendly
-   Used in enrollment and subject allocations to distinguish across years

---

### 2. **department** ‚Äì _Academic divisions like BCA, BVOC_

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
    Department_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Department_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```

-   Unique names prevent duplicates
-   Connected to subjects, classes, and teacher mappings

---

### 3. **class** ‚Äì _Represents a batch like FY BCA A_

```sql
CREATE TABLE class (
    Class_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Year_Level ENUM('FY', 'SY', 'TY') NOT NULL,
    Course_Code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Division VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT '', -- Use empty string for "no division"
    Department_ID INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES department(Department_ID)
);
```

-   Kept separate from academic year intentionally
-   Classes like `FY BCA A` stay the same each year
-   Year-wise records are tracked via student enrollment instead

---

### 4. **student** ‚Äì _Student personal details_

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    Student_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Student_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Student_Rollno INT NOT NULL
);
```

-   Stores only static identity info
-   No semester/year here to avoid duplication and keep records atomic

---

### 5. **student_semester_enrollment** ‚Äì _Links students to class/semester/year_

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_semester_enrollment (
    Record_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Student_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Class_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Semester INT NOT NULL,
    Year_Label VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES student(Student_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Class_ID) REFERENCES class(Class_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Year_Label) REFERENCES academic_year(Year_Label)
);
```

-   Allows the same student to appear in different semesters and years
-   Central to admin uploads (CSV files are parsed into this table)

---

### 6. **subject** ‚Äì _All subjects grouped by semester and department_

```sql
CREATE TABLE subject (
    Subject_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Subject_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Semester INT NOT NULL,
    Department_ID INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES department(Department_ID)
);
```

-   Mapped directly to departments (e.g., ‚ÄòWeb Dev‚Äô in BCA)
-   Reused across academic years

---

### 7. **teacher** ‚Äì _Holds teacher details_

```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher (
    Teacher_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Teacher_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Teacher_Initial VARCHAR(20),
    Teacher_Designation VARCHAR(100)
);
```

-   Teachers can be reused across years and departments
-   Initials are helpful for UI abbreviation (e.g., ‚ÄòAMR‚Äô for Arvind M. Rao)

---

### 8. **teacher_department** ‚Äì _Many-to-many mapping between teachers and departments_

```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher_department (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Teacher_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Department_ID INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Teacher_ID) REFERENCES teacher(Teacher_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES department(Department_ID),
    UNIQUE (Teacher_ID, Department_ID)
);
```

-   Ensures that teachers like a Math teacher can teach in both BCA and BVOC
-   Used during subject allocation

---

### 9. **tr_subject_allocation** ‚Äì _Tracks which teacher teaches which subject, to which class, in which semester and year_

```sql
CREATE TABLE tr_subject_allocation (
    Allocation_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Teacher_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Subject_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Class_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Semester INT NOT NULL,
    Year_Label VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Teacher_ID) REFERENCES teacher(Teacher_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Subject_ID) REFERENCES subject(Subject_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Class_ID) REFERENCES class(Class_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Year_Label) REFERENCES academic_year(Year_Label),
    INDEX idx_allocation_sem_year (Semester, Year_Label)
);
```

-   This is how the frontend knows which subject to show the teacher
-   One teacher can teach multiple subjects to multiple classes

---

### 10. **attendance** ‚Äì _Stores P/A/L status by student/date/subject/class_

```sql
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    Attendance_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Student_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Subject_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Class_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Attendance_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Status ENUM('P', 'A', 'L') NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES student(Student_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Subject_ID) REFERENCES subject(Subject_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Class_ID) REFERENCES class(Class_ID),
    UNIQUE (Student_ID, Subject_ID, Attendance_Date),
    INDEX idx_subject_date (Subject_ID, Attendance_Date)
);
```

-   Matches the frontend‚Äôs sheet view (students vs dates)
-   `Class_ID` allows joins with subject allocation
-   `UNIQUE` constraint prevents duplicate marking

---

### 11. **user_table** ‚Äì _Holds login and access control_

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_table (
    User_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    User_Type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    IsActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    Reference_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Reference_ID) REFERENCES teacher(Teacher_ID)
);
```

-   Required for all roles (admin, teacher, etc.)
-   A teacher must be here to log in, but admins/principals don‚Äôt need to exist in the `teacher` table
-   `Reference_ID` connects login accounts to teacher identity when needed
